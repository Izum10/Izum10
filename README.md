### 🧠 About Me

I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at Western University, recently wrapping up a **16-month co-op at Celestica** as a **Robotic Process Automation Developer**, where I built scalable internal tools and automation pipelines that saved real hours — not just lines of code.

I'm drawn to clean systems, sharp interfaces, and projects with real impact. I care about how things **feel**, not just how they function — and I believe code should be both powerful *and* elegant.

Currently:
- 🔧 Building full-stack projects in **React, Node.js, Java, Python**
- ⚙️ Automating systems that make workflows simpler and smarter
- 🧠 Learning fast, shipping faster

I write code with intention. I value design that makes sense. And I’m here to build what matters.
